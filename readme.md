# Aerofit - Descriptive Statistics & Probability

### About Aerofit
Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.

### Business Problem

The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

<ul><li>Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.</li>
<li>For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.</li></ul>

### <a href=https://github.com/adarshvinayak/Aerofit-Descriptive-Statistics-and-Probability/blob/main/aerofit_treadmill.csv> Dataset </a>

<ul><li>Product Purchased: 	KP281, KP481, or KP781</li>
<li>Age: 	In years</li>
<li>Gender: 	Male/Female</li>
<li>Education: 	In years</li>
<li>MaritalStatus: 	Single or partnered</li>
<li>Usage: 	The average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week.</li>
<li>Income: 	Annual income (in $)</li>
<li>Fitness: 	Self-rated fitness on a 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is the poor shape and 5 is the excellent shape.</li>
<li>Miles: 	The average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week</li></ul>

### Process

<ol>
  <li>Preliminary Analysis : Understanding the datatypes, range and key features</li>
  <li>Data Cleaning : Removing bad data, detecting outliers, filling missing values categorizing attributes and splitting data</li>
  <li>Data Analysis : Finding the correlation between attributes through value counts, unique attributes, charts and plots.</li>
  <li>Customer Profile Generation : Using marginal and conditional probability, customer profiles for each product is created</li>
</ol>

### Reccomendations derived from the insights

1. Obtaining a fitness rating from a customer through a survey can help identify the model that they would most
likely purchase. Higher the fitness rating the higher they might spend.

2. Introducing a new model that sits between the mid level and advanced level model could attract a lot of
consumers. The advanced model can be pitched to consumers between age 20-30, and that can be used as an
anchor to sell this newly introduced model.

3.Special offers or coupons can be provided to partnered consumers in order to upsell the mid level and
advanced level models. A referal bonus could also boost sales among this category of consumers.
Discounts for females on the advanced models.

4. Entry level consumers can be given discounts to motivate them to upgrade to a newer model.
