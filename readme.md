The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

<ul><li>Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.</li>
<li>For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.</li></ul>
